# Personal OpenWrt Branch

This is where I goof around with OpenWrt. Take a look at the other branches.


## Current Projects

### glibc

Bringing modern glibc 2.21 back into OpenWrt, as an alternative to the no-longer-maintained eglibc.

### nodejs

Packages for node.js and io.js

### master

The `master` branch should be relatively up-to-date with upstream.


## See Also

### systemd

I'm working on (systemd support)[https://github.com/jdub/openwrt-systemd] in a separate repo so you can use it as a package source.

### packages

I have also (contributed some packages)[https://github.com/jdub/openwrt-packages] to the OpenWrt package repository.
