# Jeff's OpenWrt Branch

This is where I goof around with OpenWrt. Take a look at the other branches for my stuff. (The `master` branch just tracks upstream.)


## Current Projects

### glibc 2.21 (glibc)

Bringing modern glibc back into OpenWrt, as an alternative to the no-longer-maintained eglibc.

### Go support (golang)

Hopefully shepherding Geert-Johan's [gccgo/libgo patches](https://github.com/GeertJohan/openwrt-go/tree/add-gccgo-and-libgo) into mainline.

### uClibc snapshots

The last uClibc release was in May 2012, and there have been changes in git since, so having a snapshot option would be grouse.


## See Also

### nodejs

Packages for node.js and io.js

### systemd

I'm working on [systemd support](https://github.com/jdub/openwrt-systemd) in a separate repo so you can use it as a package source.

### packages

I have also [contributed some packages](https://github.com/jdub/openwrt-packages) to the OpenWrt package repository.
