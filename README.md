# Jeff's OpenWrt Branch

This is where I goof around with OpenWrt. Take a look at the other branches for my stuff. (The `master` branch just tracks upstream.)


## Current Projects

### glibc

Bringing modern glibc 2.21 back into OpenWrt, as an alternative to the no-longer-maintained eglibc.

### nodejs

Packages for node.js and io.js


## See Also

### systemd

I'm working on [systemd support](https://github.com/jdub/openwrt-systemd) in a separate repo so you can use it as a package source.

### packages

I have also [contributed some packages](https://github.com/jdub/openwrt-packages) to the OpenWrt package repository.
